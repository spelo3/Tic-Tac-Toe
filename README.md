# Tic-Tac-Toe (WIP)

Your classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Jquery

We created this game using jQuery functions to continue our practice with objects and closures. The rules of the assignment is listed below:

<li>It is randomly determined who goes first</li>
<li>When an empty square is clicked, it is recorded as a play for whoever's turn it currently is</li>
<li>When a filled square is clicked, nothing happens</li>
<li>We need to check for a winner after every play</li>
<li>When a winner is determined, the game halts, and the winner is announced</li>
<li>When the game reaches a stalemate, the game halts, and the stalemate is announced</li>

For this exercise we used Agile methodologies to construct our game. The tasks to be completed are listed below:

<strong>Task 1:</strong><br>
<em>As a user, I can put 'X' anywhere on the board.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 2:</strong><br>
<em>As a user, I can only put 'X' on the board where there are no markings already.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 3:</strong><br>
<em>As two users, we can alternate between putting 'X' and 'O's on the board; starting with 'X'.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 4:</strong><br>
<em>As two users, we can only place markings where there are no markings already so that we cannot override our own or the opponents markings.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 5:</strong><br>
<em>As two users alternating between putting markings on the board, the computer will inform us when there are no more empty positions and the game is over.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 6:</strong><br>
<em>As two users, playing the game, when board is full, the computer
will tell us who won 'X' or 'O' or if the game ended in a stalemate.</em>
<br>

<strong>Task 7:</strong><br>
<em>As two users, playing the game, as soon as a player won the computer
will tell us who won 'X' or 'O'.</em>
<br>

<strong>Extra Tasks:</strong><br>
<em>As two users, before the game starts, the computer asks for each player's name so that the computer can prompt the users with their name when it's their turn.</em>
<br>

<em>As two users, before the game starts, the computer asks for each player's name so that the computer can name the winner at the end of the game.</em>
<br>

<em>As two users, after a game, the computer asks if you want to play again, and if so resets the board so that the users do not need to enter their names again.</em>
<br>

<em>Most of the time players will play several games of Tic Tac Toe in a row. <br>
They will want to keep track of the number of times 'X' won, and the number of times 'O' won.
<br>
They will also start the next game with the winner of the last game going first.
<br>
We are going to refactor our working Tic Tac Toe Query game to handle these multiple game behaviors.</em>
